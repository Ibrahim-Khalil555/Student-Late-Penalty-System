# Student-Late-Penalty-System

* Class start at 10:00AM.
* To make calculation easy convert Hours to Minutes (10*60=600 minutes).
* "Allow" until 5 minutes late.
* After that for each 5 Minutes late penalty 1 point.
* For each 1 point Fine 10Tk.
* If students are late more than 30 minutes late, "Don't Allow".

### Note: I allow students until 5 minute late. But when I apply fine, it will count on total late time.
